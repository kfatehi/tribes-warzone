Subject: novamorpher scripts
To: daggerandcloaked@gmail.com

Hello,

I have attached the novamorpher mod as per your request. It is simply an archive of what I have in my Tribes folder in scripts form (may be more useful to you). I took a look at some of my scripts, it looks like I at least informally credited my sources. I definitely pulled things from Meltdown Classic/Hell, Shifter, and Chivalry (and maayybe Annihilation). You can unzip tar.bz2 with 7-zip (http://www.7-zip.org/) or winrar.

Thanks,
Benson Tsai (VRWarper)
