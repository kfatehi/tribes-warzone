IMPORTANT!
==========
Do NOT change the names of the .png files or Tribes will crash when you use the model.
Choose only ONE flag and only ONE flag stand.
Choose only ONE grenade.
Choose only ONE spinfusor.


Instructions:
=============
Move all the .dts and .png files into your Base folder. (ie C:\Dynamix\TRIBES\Base)
If you use the shotgun, move ALL of the .png files, it needs all of them, it is not a customization choice.

I have included a file called Model List.txt, it lists the names of the models used in Tribes, in case you want to use them for something other than what I named them.


Team Based Skins:
=================
The flags and flag stands support skins for each team.  I only provide skins for Base and the team the flag/flag stand belongs to.
The armors support skins for each team.  I only provide skins for Base and Blood Eagle.


Multiple Skins:
===============
The grenades come with different skins to pick from.  Tribes will recognize only "frag.png", "impact.png", and "stickygren.png" so if you want to use one of the other skins, just rename it.
The medium spinfusor comes with two skins to pick from.  Tribes will recognize only "TA_spinfusor_med.png", so if you want to use the green one, just rename it.


Known Issues / Notes:
=====================
The discs do not spin on the spinfusors.  I don't know how to get them to spin, I tried.
One of the spinfusors twitches.  I have no idea why.
You can walk through the generator if you host a server with it.  I don't know how to get collision models set up correctly, I tried.

There are no Diamond Sword armors included.  I started working on them, but the porportions are not correct.  When I started to adjust them to work with the bones for the armors, they started looking really weird and deformed.  So, no dsword, sorry.
